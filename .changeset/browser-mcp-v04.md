Add Playwright browser automation and MCP client support.

**Browser automation** — agents get a `browser_*` tool suite (navigate, snapshot, click, type, hover, select, fill_form, press_key, go_back, tabs, take_screenshot, console, network) backed by a persistent per-agent Playwright session that survives across turns. Perception is accessibility-tree-first (`browser_snapshot` returns an aria tree with `[ref=eN]` element refs — no vision model needed); screenshots are a secondary, multimodal escape hatch rendered inline in chat. A network-layer SSRF guard blocks loopback/private targets (override with `BROWSER_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK` for local dev). Configure on `/config` (Browser Automation) or via env. Run `pnpm exec playwright install chromium` once.

**MCP client** — connect the daemon to Model Context Protocol servers over stdio (local subprocess), Streamable-HTTP, or SSE (with optional bearer auth). Each enabled server's tools are discovered and injected into every agent turn, namespaced `mcp__<server>__<tool>`. Manage with `bazilion mcp add|list|show|rm|enable|disable|test` or the `/config/mcp` page.

Both run as long-lived daemon-side resources (idle-reaped, closed on shutdown) reached from the stateless per-turn worker over IPC. Tool results are now multimodal (text + images).
