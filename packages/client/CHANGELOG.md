## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Release v0.1.1.

  - **Shared USER.md editing for agents.** New `user_md_get` / `user_md_write` tools let any agent in a group update the shared USER.md with optimistic-etag concurrency control. Previously agents could only read it. USER.md is capped at 12 KB (it's inlined into every system prompt).
  - **Provider expansion.** Switched the underlying pi-ai package from `@mariozechner/pi-ai` to `@earendil-works/pi-ai`. New providers wired through `loadProviderConfigFromEnv`: DeepSeek, Fireworks, Together, Moonshot AI, Kimi Coding, MiniMax, Xiaomi MiMo, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot, Cloudflare AI Gateway, Cloudflare Workers AI, llama.cpp.
  - **Web fetch tool hardened.** Readability extraction + markdown output, SSRF guard with DNS-rebinding re-validation, 15-min LRU per `${mode}|${url}`. UA spoofs desktop Safari.
  - **Worker IPC protocol extended.** `UserMdHost` joins `MessagingHost` as a daemon-side RPC surface; the worker no longer needs a SQLite handle to touch shared state.
  - **Web UI polish.** Services config page, root chat layout, theme tokens, FieldRow component.
  - **Backlog system grows.** BAZ-002 (Profile Groups — preconfigured team templates) and BAZ-003 (Hermes-style self-learning loop) added as drafts under `docs/backlog/draft/`.
